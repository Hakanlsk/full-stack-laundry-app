REACT NATIVE - FIREBASE - LAUNDRY APP

üîë Project Features:

Firebase Authentication:
The project utilizes Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign up and log in securely. The streamlined user authentication process ensures a quick and secure user experience.

Firestore Database:
Using Firestore database, we store user information, creating a dedicated document for each user. This allows us to securely manage personalized data for each user.

User Cart Functionality:
Users can add products to their carts within the application. This cart information is securely stored in a Firestore document unique to each user. This enables users to access and modify their cart contents.

Data Retrieval and Usage:
Data retrieval operations from Firestore database enable fast access to user-saved information. This not only enhances application performance but also provides users with a personalized experience.

To manage the application's state effectively, I integrated Redux with the project. Two slices, CartSlice and ProductSlice, handle the state related to the user's cart and product information, respectively.
